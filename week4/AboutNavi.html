  <h1>About Navi</h1>
  <p>The idea of Navi came to me around 2018 -2017. I was working as a private security officer
    after I left the Army. The security company I worked for was had mostly grocery store contracts.
    Armed and unarmed alike, I worked both which means I spent a lot of time in grocery stores.
    One thing I was always asked was "where can I find this?" and there were some people who would
    just wonder around until asked if they need help. So I thought why isn't there an app for that
    yet? we have all the thing parts and technology for it? Then I thought even more on it and came
    up with a list that gets organized based off the store you're in and whats on your list and orders
    them based on proximity and how close the items are to each other, This is Navigation for items
    or Navi for short.
